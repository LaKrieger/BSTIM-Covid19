# The BSTI Model

The BSTI model is a [Bayesian spatio-temporal interaction model][1], a probabilistic generalized linear model, that predicts aggregated case counts within spatial regions (counties) and time intervals (calendar weeks) using a history of reported cases, temporal features (seasonality and trend) and region-specific as well as demographic information.

The model is implemented in Python and relies on the [PyMC3][2] and [Theano][3] packages for computationally efficient sampling.

Key features of the model:

* a single probabilistic model learns to predict the number of weekly case counts for three different diseases (campylobacteriosis, rotaviralenteritis and Lyme borreliosis) at the county level one week ahead of time
* a Bayesian Monte Carlo regression approach provides an estimate of the full probability distribution over inferred parameters as well as model predictions.
* the model learns an interpretable spatio-temporal kernel that captures typical interactions between infection cases of the tested diseases.

## Setup
It is recommended to install a local virtual environment for python3, a requirements.txt is provided.

# Data sources
## Epidemiological data
The data is provided by the [Robert Koch Institute][4], and consists of weekly reports of case counts for three diseases, campylobacteriosis, rotavirus infections and Lyme borreliosis. They are aggregated by county and collected over a time period spanning from the 1st of January 2011 (2013 for borreliosis) to the 31st of December 2017 via the *SurvNet* surveillance system. Aggregated case counts of diseases with mandatory reporting in Germany is available [online][5].

## Covid-19
Covid-19 data is provided by the [Robert Koch Institute][4] via the publically accessiable (this)[https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0/data?orderBy=Meldedatum] link. The downloadable CSV table can be found in ./data/raw and is preprocessed to fit the BSTI Model implementation via the notebook ./notebooks/preprocess_covid19_data.ipynb.


## Geospatial data
Information about the shape of counties within Germany is publicly provided by the [German federal agency for cartography and geodesy (Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie)][6] (© GeoBasis-DE / BKG 2018) under the [dl-de/by-2-0 license][7].
